# Welcome to the StoryEngine guide!

## StoryEngine is a narrative-based methodology

StoryEngine is a narrative-based methodology that can be used for research, evaluation, and grant reporting. Drawing on deep listening and participatory approaches, StoryEngine systematically collects and analyzes successes, challenges, practices, perceptions, and more — while generating assets that participants can use to promote and amplify their work.

StoryEngine was specifically designed to serve organizational learning and innovation, power feedback loops, and provide insights to guide strategy and design decisions. Most importantly, it recognizes that _**an interview is an experience**_— a touchpoint with an organization — and therefore an opportunity to build relationships, provide support, and make connections.

In short, the core methodology uses in-depth interviews to draft impact narratives that are then co-edited in collaboration with each participant and published under an [open license](http://opendefinition.org/licenses/). \(For specific use cases with sensitive information, such as grant reporting and organizational learning, investigators may elect to create internal and external versions.\) These narratives can then be used to generate assets — for marketing and communications, advocacy, onboarding, and more — while together forming a dataset that can be analyzed using qualitative data analysis methods.

The result: A rich set of narratives and evidence about the people and organizations touched by an organization’s work, and a platform for engagement and insights.

## Why use StoryEngine?

StoryEngine is useful for organizations who are interested in learning from others — whether it’s learning about the people within your organization, the people your organization serves, or the people you fund. Organizations of all sizes face a similar problem: Bridging the gap between their objectives and what’s actually happening. That gap is rich, worthy of investigation, and can reveal important insights — if you have a way to tap it and act on what you learn.
